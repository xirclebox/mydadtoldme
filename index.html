      <p>
        This is the shortest pep talk I ever received from my Dad as a kid and a
        phrase that has stuck with me throughout the years. This rule can apply
        to situations where "them" can be anyone who stands between you and your
        goal. It also means you have to put the work in. Never make it easy or
        give them a reason to deny you. Make telling you "No" a burden for them
        to justify.
      </p>

      <h2 class="main__heading">Don't cast long shadows.</h2>
      <p>
        This message applies to situations where maintaining your disciplined
        and having self-control keep you from responding out of emotion. It also
        means to think about what you are doing beyond the moment. Mind your
        actions, don't let something you do today negatively impact you
        tomorrow.
